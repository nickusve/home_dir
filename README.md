# Home Dir
This repo contains various configurations, alises, etc that I use. The setup script is meant to configure a new computer in the way that I like.

## Setup
Either clone the repo and run the script, or use the setup script directly

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickusve/home_dir/refs/heads/main/setup.sh | bash
